# Self-hosting on your own infrastructure

**English** | [Tiếng Việt](DEPLOYMENT.vi.md)

Local development and CI use `demo-chotcong` on loopback without cloud credentials. Supply your own Firebase, Vercel, and IAM resources for a hosted deployment. Keep `.env.local` dedicated to emulators; do not pull production variables into it.

## Preparation

1. Create a separate Firebase project, enable the Google provider, and register a Web App. Choose the Firestore location before creating the database. Review quotas and costs for services you enable.
2. Create a Vercel project from your fork/repository, using Node 24, `npm ci`, and `npm run build`. Use a stable HTTPS hostname. Set APP_ORIGIN to that exact origin and add its hostname to Firebase Auth authorized domains.
3. Review and deploy `firebase/firestore.rules` and `firebase/firestore.indexes.json` to the correct project. Rules deny all clients; Admin APIs still need UID isolation. Wait for composite indexes to be READY. For a shared project, review existing Rules/indexes and preserve unrelated configuration.
4. Set up backend access using WIF below, complete the environment configuration, and rebuild to embed NEXT_PUBLIC settings. Keep sign-in unavailable when configuration is incomplete.

## Hosting environment variables

Use your Firebase Web App's configuration:

- `APP_ORIGIN`: your deployment's HTTPS origin.
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: the same real project you own.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, and any additional Web App identifiers.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_USE_EMULATORS=false`; omit `FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST` and `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST`.
- `FIREBASE_ADMIN_AUTH_MODE=vercel-oidc`.
- `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`: the full resource name of your WIF provider.
- `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: a service account in that Firebase project.
- `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-require-module` for Vercel's runtime with Firebase Admin ESM.

Never put credentials in NEXT_PUBLIC variables, copy old OIDC tokens, hardcode access tokens, or commit service-account keys. On Node hosts outside Vercel, the adapter supports ADC through GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS; keep credentials outside the checkout and use your host's secret management. Emulators are local/CI only.

## Vercel OIDC / Workload Identity Federation

The application currently permits OIDC only in the technical **Production** environment of the trusted Vercel project. Previews do not use its production identity. For staging, use separate Firebase and Vercel projects; do not broaden production trust to all previews.

`scripts/gcp/setup-vercel-wif.sh` is an administrative template. After reviewing IAM changes, provide **your own identifiers**:

```bash
export CC_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project
export CC_PROJECT_NUMBER=YOUR_NUMERIC_PROJECT_NUMBER
export CC_VERCEL_TEAM_SLUG=your-team
export CC_VERCEL_TEAM_ID=YOUR_TEAM_ID
export CC_VERCEL_PROJECT_NAME=your-vercel-project
export CC_VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
bash scripts/gcp/setup-vercel-wif.sh --print-config
```

Replace every placeholder with exact values returned by Google/Vercel. `--print-config` prints non-secret identifiers only. Missing or malformed values are rejected. To create APIs/pool/provider/service account and grant data/Auth permissions, authenticate gcloud with appropriate administrative permissions, set `CC_CONFIRM_PROJECT` to the exact CC_PROJECT_ID, and run the script without arguments. This performs real IAM changes: read the script and verify the project number and permissions first. It stops if an existing provider differs from the expected configuration and creates no private key.

Trust restricts issuer/audience, immutable team/project IDs, the production environment, and the exact subject. Do not grant Owner/Editor to the runtime. Datastore User/Firebase Auth Admin permissions remain broad within a project; use separate projects for data isolation.

## Configuration deployment and preflight

Normally, review the configuration and deploy it through Firebase Console/CLI with an explicit project. `scripts/gcp/apply-firestore-config.ts` is retained as a safe-apply reference: **its target is the placeholder `your-firebase-project`, with project number `000000000000`**. Before using it against cloud resources, replace both the target and project-number allowlist with your identifiers and update the corresponding unit fixtures. Never use the placeholder as a real target.

The helper runs only when FIREBASE_APPLY_CONFIG matches its fixed target, Vercel Production/OIDC configuration is complete, and emulators are disabled. It rejects unfamiliar Rules, adds missing indexes, preserves unrelated configuration, and waits for READY. If you use this path, grant limited Rules/index permissions for the target while applying changes, then remove those permissions and FIREBASE_APPLY_CONFIG. Normal builds are read-only.

Prebuild checks token exchange, Auth reads, Firestore, and query/index shapes under a random nonexistent UID namespace, without creating users or tuition data. A successful build does not replace real Google OAuth, write permissions, or two-account/revocation checks.

## Post-deployment checks

```bash
npm run check:public -- https://your-app.example
```

Supply your origin; the default targets localhost. Public smoke checks are read-only: public pages, five protected pages/ten anonymous API requests, HTTPS cookies/cache/referrer controls, manifest, and icons. They do not authenticate or write business data.

On staging with fake data, check Google login A/B, HTTP UID isolation, client Rules denial, revoking A without affecting B, prices/statements/payments, share link rotation/revocation, export, deletion, and recovery. Test real devices and define support arrangements before inviting users. Establish your own backup/retention/recovery strategy; this source includes only an Emulator backup rehearsal tool, not automatic cloud backups.
